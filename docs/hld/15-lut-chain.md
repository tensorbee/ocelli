## 18. The LUT chain

This is the highest-risk arithmetic in the project. It is specified in DICOM PS3.3 C.11 and the stages apply strictly in order. Implement it once, in ocelli-pixel, and let the shader read the parameters — do not let a second copy of this logic appear anywhere.

| **Stage** | **From → To** | **Source** |
|----|----|----|
| 1\. Modality LUT | Stored → Modality | Rescale slope/intercept, or a Modality LUT Sequence which takes precedence |
| 2\. VOI LUT | Modality → Display | Window centre/width with a function, or a VOI LUT Sequence |
| 3\. Presentation LUT | Display → Display | Identity or INVERSE; presentation state may override |
| 4\. Palette / ICC | Display → RGB | Palette colour LUT, or the display colour pipeline |

### 18.1 Modality LUT

```rust
pub fn modality(sv: Stored, slope: f32, intercept: f32) -> Modality {
    Modality(sv.0 * slope + intercept)
}
```

*If a Modality LUT Sequence is present it wins over slope and intercept. PET SUV is a separate path and needs the radiopharmaceutical sequence — do not fold it in here.*

### 18.2 VOI LUT — the three functions

The differences between LINEAR and LINEAR_EXACT are a half and a one, and they are the single most commonly mis-ported detail in DICOM viewers. Copy these exactly.

```text
// PS3.3 C.11.2.1.2 -- LINEAR. Requires w >= 1.
// c' = c - 0.5 ; w' = w - 1
// x <= c' - w'/2 -> ymin
// x > c' + w'/2 -> ymax
// else y = ((x - c') / w' + 0.5) * (ymax - ymin) + ymin
// PS3.3 C.11.2.1.3.2 -- LINEAR_EXACT. Requires w > 0.
// x <= c - w/2 -> ymin
// x > c + w/2 -> ymax
// else y = ((x - c) / w + 0.5) * (ymax - ymin) + ymin
// PS3.3 C.11.2.1.3.1 -- SIGMOID. Requires w > 0.
// y = (ymax - ymin) / (1 + exp(-4 * (x - c) / w)) + ymin
```

### 18.3 The fixture that proves it

Soft-tissue CT window, centre 40, width 400, output range 0–255. Hand-computed, and it must be in the test suite before the shader is written.

| **Input (HU)** | **LINEAR** | **LINEAR_EXACT** | **Why this row** |
|----|----|----|----|
| −160 | 0.000 | 1.594 | LINEAR boundary is c'−w'/2 = −160 exactly; the comparison is \<=, so this clamps |
| 40 | 127.819 | 127.500 | The window centre. A 0.32 divergence no reviewer would see by eye |
| 240 | 255.000 | 255.000 | LINEAR upper bound is c'+w'/2 = 239, so 240 clamps |
| −60 | 63.910 | 63.750 | Mid-lower quarter; catches sign and slope errors |

|  |
|----|
| **READ THIS ROW** At the window centre the two functions differ by 0.32 of 255. That is invisible to a human comparing screenshots and immediately visible to a pixel diff. It is the entire argument for building the oracle before writing the code it validates. |

### 18.4 The shader side

```wgsl
// ocelli-render/shaders/voi.wgsl
struct VoiParams {
    center : f32,
    width : f32,
    slope : f32,
    intercept : f32,
    ymin : f32,
    ymax : f32,
    fn_kind : u32, // 0 LINEAR, 1 LINEAR_EXACT, 2 SIGMOID
    invert : u32,
};
@group(0) @binding(0) var<uniform> voi : VoiParams;
```

*A window-level drag updates thirty-two bytes per frame. No texture is re-uploaded, and that is the concrete performance claim behind Figure 2.*
